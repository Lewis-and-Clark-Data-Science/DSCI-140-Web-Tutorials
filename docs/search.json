    "text": "Welcome\nIn this tutorial, you will learn how to work with categorical data using the forcats package in the tidyverse. Categorical data is essential in data analysis, and forcats provides powerful tools for managing factors.\n\nFunctions in Focus\nBefore we dive into the exercises, let’s introduce the key functions we will be working with and provide some guidance on their syntax:\n\nas.factor(): This function can convert a variable in another format into a factor variable. Syntax: `as.factor(nonfactor_variable)\nfct_expand(): This function is used to add new levels to a factor variable. Syntax: fct_expand(factor_variable, \"new_levels\")\nfct_collapse(): Use this function to group levels in a factor variable into broader categories. Syntax: fct_collapse(factor_variable, new_levels=c(\"old_leve1\", \"old_level2\"))\nfct_recode(): This function allows you to recode levels in a factor variable. Syntax: fct_recode(factor_variable, new_level=\"old_level\")\nfct_lump_n(): Use fct_lump_n() to lump levels in a factor variable into broader categories. Syntax: fct_lump(factor_variable, n=X)\nfct_infreq(): Use fct_infreq() to reorder the levels of the factor variable to follow the frequency of observations for different factor levels. Syntax: fct_infreq(factor_variable\n\nNow, let’s proceed to the exercises!"

This tutorial also introduces the use of the $ operator to reference variables in dataframes.\n\nFunctions in Focus\nBefore we dive into the exercises, let’s introduce the key functions we will be working with and provide some guidance on their syntax: 1. c(): This function is used for combining values into a vector. It is a fundamental function in R, often used in data analysis for creating vectors which can be used as input for other functions or for data manipulation.\nSyntax: c(element1, element2, ...)\n\nsummary(): This function provides statistical summaries of the contents of an R object, such as mean, median, min, max, and quartiles for numeric data, or frequency counts for factors. It’s a quick way to get an overview of your data.\n\nSyntax when used with a dataframe: summary(df)\n\nplot(): This function is used for creating basic types of graphs such as scatterplots, line plots, histograms, etc. It’s a versatile function for quick and easy visualization of data in a dataframe.\n\nSyntax for a simple scatter plot: plot(df$column1, df$column2) (plotting data from two columns of df against each other) These functions are essential building blocks in R for data manipulation and analysis. They provide foundational capabilities for handling, exploring, and visualizing data."

    "section": "Bracket Indexing Review",
    "text": "Bracket Indexing Review\nIndexing in base R is a fundamental concept for accessing and manipulating elements within vectors and dataframes. It primarily uses brackets [] to specify the elements you want to extract or modify.\nFor Vectors: - Indexing by Position: You can access elements of a vector by their position. For instance, if v is a vector, v[2] will give you the second element of v. - Logical Indexing: You can also use logical vectors to index. If v is a vector v[v&gt;3] will return elements of v greater than 3.\nFor Dataframes: Dataframes can be indexed by row and column.\n\nIndexing by Position: To access specific elements, you can specify the row and column numbers. For instance, df[2, 3] will give you the element in the second row and third column of the dataframe df.\nLogical Indexing: Similar to vectors, you can use logical statements for indexing. For example, df[df$column_name &gt; 10, ] will give you all rows of df where the values in column_name are greater than 10."
