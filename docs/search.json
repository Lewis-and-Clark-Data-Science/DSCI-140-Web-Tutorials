You’ll learn about creating vectors, data frames, summarizing data, understanding data structures, and basic plotting. This tutorial also introduces the use of the $ operator to reference variables in dataframes.\n\nFunctions in Focus\nBefore we dive into the exercises, let’s introduce the key functions we will be working with and provide some guidance on their syntax:\n\nc(): This function is used for combining values into a vector. It is a fundamental function in R, often used in data analysis for creating vectors which can be used as input for other functions or for data manipulation.\n\nSyntax: c(element1, element2, ...)\n\nsummary(): This function provides statistical summaries of the contents of an R object, such as mean, median, min, max, and quartiles for numeric data, or frequency counts for factors. It’s a quick way to get an overview of your data.\n\nSyntax when used with a dataframe: summary(df)\n\nplot(): This function is used for creating basic types of graphs such as scatterplots, line plots, histograms, etc. It’s a versatile function for quick and easy visualization of data in a dataframe.\n\nSyntax for a simple scatter plot: plot(df$column1, df$column2) (plotting data from two columns of df against each other) These functions are essential building blocks in R for data manipulation and analysis. They provide foundational capabilities for handling, exploring, and visualizing data."

    "section": "Bracket Indexing Review",
    "text": "Bracket Indexing Review\nIndexing in base R is a fundamental concept for accessing and manipulating elements within vectors and dataframes. It primarily uses brackets [] to specify the elements you want to extract or modify.\nFor Vectors:\n\nIndexing by Position: You can access elements of a vector by their position. For instance, if v is a vector, v[2] will give you the second element of v.\nLogical Indexing: You can also use logical vectors to index. If v is a vector v[v&gt;3] will return elements of v greater than 3.\n\nFor Dataframes: Dataframes can be indexed by row and column.\n\nIndexing by Position: To access specific elements, you can specify the row and column numbers. For instance, df[2, 3] will give you the element in the second row and third column of the dataframe df.\nLogical Indexing: Similar to vectors, you can use logical statements for indexing. For example, df[df$column_name &gt; 10, ] will give you all rows of df where the values in column_name are greater than 10."

Text data is ubiquitous and manipulating strings efficiently is a fundamental skill in data analysis. stringr provides a cohesive set of functions designed to make string manipulation easy and consistent.\n\nFunctions in Focus\nLet’s familiarize ourselves with the essential functions from stringr that we’ll explore in this tutorial, along with their syntax:\n\nstr_sub(): This function allows you to extract substrings in a character vector.\n\nSyntax: str_sub(string, start_position, end_position)\n\nstr_to_lower(): Use this function to transform text to all lowercase.\n\nSyntax: str_to_lower(string)\n\nword(): This function will extract a specific word from a string (or character vector).\n\nSyntax: word(string, start, end, sep=fixed(\"___\"))\n\nstr_remove(): Use str_remove() to eliminate the first instance of a pattern in a string.\n\nSyntax: str_remove(string, pattern)\n\nstr_length(): This function will give the number of characters in each element of a character vector.\n\nSyntax: str_length(string)\n\nstr_detect(): This function will look at each element of a string and determine if it matches a given pattern. For each element, it will output FALSE or TRUE depending on whether it matches the pattern.\n\nSyntax: str_detect(string, pattern)\nWith these tools at your disposal, you’ll be able to tackle a wide array of text processing tasks. Let’s proceed to the exercises and start putting these functions to work!"

    "section": "Bracket Indexing Review",
    "text": "Bracket Indexing Review\nIndexing in base R is a fundamental concept for accessing and manipulating elements within vectors and dataframes. It primarily uses brackets [] to specify the elements you want to extract or modify.\nFor Vectors: - Indexing by Position: You can access elements of a vector by their position. For instance, if v is a vector, v[2] will give you the second element of v. - Logical Indexing: You can also use logical vectors to index. If v is a vector v[v&gt;3] will return elements of v greater than 3.\nFor Dataframes: Dataframes can be indexed by row and column.\n\nIndexing by Position: To access specific elements, you can specify the row and column numbers. For instance, df[2, 3] will give you the element in the second row and third column of the dataframe df.\nLogical Indexing: Similar to vectors, you can use logical statements for indexing. For example, df[df$column_name &gt; 10, ] will give you all rows of df where the values in column_name are greater than 10."
